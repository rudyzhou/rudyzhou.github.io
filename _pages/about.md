I am a third-year PhD student in the Operations Research Department at Carnegie Mellon University. In particular, I am a student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) Program](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/). My advisor is [Ben Moseley](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/).

Previously, I obtained a MS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was advised by [Brendan Juba](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~bjuba/).

# Research Interests

I am generally interested in **Combinatorial Optimization**. This includes:
* **Approximation Algorithms** for fundamental clustering and scheduling problems
* Studying the power of **Convex Relaxations** for these problems
* Algorithms for the setting of stochastic inputs **(Stochastic Optimization)**
