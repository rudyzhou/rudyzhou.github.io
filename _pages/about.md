I am a 5th (and final) year PhD student in the Operations Research Department at Carnegie Mellon University. In particular, I am a student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) Program](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/). My advisor is [Ben Moseley](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/).

In Summer 2022, I was an intern at Microsoft Research Redmond in the [Cloud Operations Research (CORE) group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cloud-operations-research-core/), where my mentor was [Konstantina Mellou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kmellou/).

Previously, I obtained a MS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was advised by [Brendan Juba](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~bjuba/).

Here is my [CV](https://rudyzhou.github.io/files/rudy-cv-10-11.pdf). My e-mail is: _rbz@andrew.cmu.edu_. Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DCB2z-cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/260/0730.html).

**I am on the job market for both academia and research positions in industry.** 
**I will be attending the 2022 INFORMS Annual Meeting and presenting my job talk there in session TC44 on October 18, 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM in CC - Room 206. I am avaiable to meet at INFORMS from October 16 - 18.**

# Research Interests

Currently, my main interests are **Optimization under Uncertainty** and **Data-driven Optimization**. I am very interested in developing new models and technical tools to design and analyze algorithms for fundamental problems in these areas. Some particular models I am investigating are **stochastic**, **online**, and **with predictions**. More broadly, I am interested in Approximation Algorithms and Combinatorial Optimization.
