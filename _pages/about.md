I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Operations Research Department at Carnegie Mellon University. In particular, I am a student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) Program](http://aco.math.cmu.edu/). My advisor is [Ben Moseley](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/).

Previously, I obtained a MS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, where I was advised by [Brendan Juba](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~bjuba/).

Here is my [CV](https://rudyzhou.github.io/files/rudy_cv_10_21.pdf). My e-mail is: _rbz@andrew.cmu.edu_.

# Research Interests

Currently, my main interest is **Optimization under Uncertainty** including **Online**, **Stochstic**, and **with Predictions**. I am very interested in developing new techincal tools to understand and leverage **Adaptivity** in stochastic models. More broadly, I am interested in Approximation Algorithms and Combinatorial Optimization.
